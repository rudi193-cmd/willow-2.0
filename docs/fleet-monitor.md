# Willow Fleet Monitor

## Knowledge Base Health

@db using="willow" raw="SELECT category, tier, COUNT(*) as atoms, ROUND(AVG(confidence)::numeric, 2) as avg_conf FROM knowledge WHERE invalid_at IS NULL GROUP BY category, tier ORDER BY category, tier" | @render type="table"

## Recently Invalidated Atoms (last 48h)

@db using="willow" raw="SELECT id, title, category, to_char(invalid_at, 'MM-DD HH24:MI') as retired FROM knowledge WHERE invalid_at IS NOT NULL AND invalid_at > now() - interval '48 hours' ORDER BY invalid_at DESC LIMIT 10" | @render type="table"

## MCP Tool Activity (last 24h)

@db using="willow" raw="SELECT tool, COUNT(*) as calls, SUM(CASE WHEN ok THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as ok, SUM(CASE WHEN NOT ok THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as errors, ROUND(AVG(latency_ms)) as avg_ms, ROUND(MAX(latency_ms)) as max_ms FROM willow.mcp_receipts WHERE ts > now() - interval '24 hours' GROUP BY tool ORDER BY calls DESC LIMIT 20" | @render type="table"

## Recent Errors (last 24h)

@db using="willow" raw="SELECT ts::time::text as time, app_id, tool, error_type FROM willow.mcp_receipts WHERE ts > now() - interval '24 hours' AND NOT ok ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 10" | @render type="table"

## Governance History (open + recent)

@db using="willow" raw="SELECT id, title, tier, ROUND(confidence::numeric, 2) as conf, to_char(valid_at, 'MM-DD HH24:MI') as date, CASE WHEN invalid_at IS NULL THEN 'open' ELSE 'closed' END as status FROM knowledge WHERE category IN ('governance', 'handoff') ORDER BY valid_at DESC LIMIT 15" | @render type="table"

## KB Ingestion Rate (last 7 days, by day)

@db using="willow" raw="SELECT to_char(valid_at, 'MM-DD') as day, COUNT(*) as ingested, SUM(CASE WHEN invalid_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as retired FROM knowledge WHERE valid_at > now() - interval '7 days' GROUP BY to_char(valid_at, 'MM-DD') ORDER BY day DESC" | @render type="table"

Before any fleet-wide operation:
1. Check MCP Tool Activity for elevated error rates on critical tools (kb_ingest, soil_put, fleet_status).
2. Review Governance History for open handoff atoms — these may contain in-flight work.
3. If Recently Invalidated Atoms shows unexpected retirements, investigate before proceeding.
4. Error rate >10% on any tool = surface to user before continuing.
5. Load open handoff atoms via kb_get using their id before starting new work.
